🏠 Human Activity Recognition using Supervised Learning
This project implements a full machine learning pipeline to recognize human activities (like walking, sitting, laying, etc.) using synthetic sensor data. It simulates a smart home or wearable environment where sensor readings are used to classify the activity being performed.

The project includes:

✅ Dataset simulation
✅ Data preprocessing, cleaning, and feature selection
✅ PCA and regularization
✅ Supervised learning models including XGBoost
✅ Model evaluation with confusion matrix, R², MAE, RMSE, learning curves
✅ Gradient Descent demo for y = mx + c
✅ Interactive Streamlit web app for predictions
✅ Jupyter Notebook with visualizations and analysis
